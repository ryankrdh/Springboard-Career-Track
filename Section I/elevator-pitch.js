Tell me about yourself

Well, my name is Ryan, and I’ve been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I got into programming back in Nov 2020 during the pandemic. I took a tutorial on javascript, html, css, python and worked on some small projects. The progress was slow since at that time I was working 50 hours a week. 

The reason I got into coding was because in dental, you study the medicine, anatomy, and learn the clinical skills and then you work on patients.. that’s it. There really is no challenges you face in my field that you can find in programming. I would constantly get stuck when programming, I feel helpless and hopeless but by learning how to take bite sized challenges of the problem, knowing what to google, I can eventually come up with a solution. I love the feeling of accomplishment that you feel after solving a problem. You just don’t get that in my line of work.

Eventually I found myself programming every night after work because I loved the feeling of overcoming constant hurdles the programming has to offer. So I wanted to take this to the next level and make it my career. I joined a bootcamp called springboard back in sept 2021 and will be graduating in June. What I’m looking for is, a group of people passionate about tech, prioritizing communication, teamwork, and empathy. Because I believe that to have a healthy work culture and to achieve maximum efficiency, those three aspects have to be there.
