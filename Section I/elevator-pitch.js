Tell me about yourself

Well, my name is Ryan, and I’ve been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I got into programming back in Nov 2020 during the pandemic. I took a tutorial on javascript, html, css, python and worked on some small projects. The progress was slow since at that time I was working 50 hours a week. 

The reason I got into coding was because in dental, you study the medicine, anatomy, and learn the clinical skills and then you work on patients.. that’s it. There really is no challenges you face in my field that you can find in programming. I would constantly get stuck when programming, I feel helpless and hopeless but by learning how to take bite sized challenges of the problem, knowing what to google, I can eventually come up with a solution. I love the feeling of accomplishment that you feel after solving a problem. You just don’t get that in my line of work.

Eventually I found myself programming every night after work because I loved the feeling of overcoming constant hurdles the programming has to offer. So I wanted to take this to the next level and make it my career. I joined a bootcamp called springboard back in sept 2021 and will be graduating in June. What I’m looking for is, a group of people passionate about tech, prioritizing communication, teamwork, and empathy. Because I believe that to have a healthy work culture and to achieve maximum efficiency, those three aspects have to be there.


Why do you want to work for us:
One of your mission statement from the job application really stood out for me. “Making a difference in our members’ and customers’ lives is what we do. Even when it’s hard, we do the right thing for the right reasons.”

GENERAL PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE

Q: Functional programming vs OOP
A: Functional programming emphasizes on evaluation of functions(bug-free code, easily invoked and reused so very good for modular programming) while OOP is based on concept of objects. In OOP, when increasing the level of inheritance, it can break the principle of encapsulation.
DATA: FP uses immutable data. OOP uses mutable data.
MODEL: FP uses declarative programming model. OOP uses imperative. Imperative you decide step by step what you want. Declarative focuses on end result and imperative focuses on how to get there.
SUPPORT: parallel programming is supported by FP and NOT OOP. Parallel programming is beneficial when dealing with large data. Ex: videos, encryption, images. 
EXECUTION: FP can be executed in any order. OOP need to be executed in particular order.
ITERATION: FP uses recursion and OOP uses loops 
ELEMENT: FP uses variables and functions. OOP uses Objects and methods
 
For reusability. OOP is not as reusable since some functions depend on the class that is using them. Makes it less efficient and more complex. 
OOP is good when you have fixed set of operations on things. FP is good when you have fixed set of things.
* If we are on front end, functional programming is better because we are working with mostly JSON objects. We don’t have to mess with object in an object.



Q: single vs double quotes for python.
A: Normally single quotes are used for regex, dict keys, and SQL. Double quotes for strings.



Q: people will be building things at the same time at diff times, what is your solution to this? How would you manage this.
A: version control like git and subversion. I like git better because if the central repo goes down on subversion, all other developers can’t commit their code until it’s fixed. Also git can work offline.



Q: Modern websites often need to take into account the form of device a visitor is viewing the site on (tablet, pc, phone) what design pattern would you use?
A: Responsive design. Using bootstrap.



Q: what is responsive web design?
A: responsive web design uses media queries to target breakpoints that scale images, wrap text, and adjust the layout. Fluid web design uses percentages as relative indicators. Fixed design uses fixed pixel widths.



Q: explain what object oriented programming and the benefits of using an OOP.
A: OOP encourages developers to think of their applications like a real object. With OOP, each object is defined as a class and an instance of this class is created to form the object. Benefits are: code-reusability, modular programming, flexibility. I like OOP because I can break down the problem into bite sized chunks.
encapsulation(when each object maintains a private state. It means no other class can alter it.), 
abstraction (selecting data from a larger data source to only show relevant details. This means that we can use it for more than one applications with little modification),
inheritance (you don’t want to repeat code if you don’t have to), having a child class under a parent class and inherit some of the parent class’s attributes.
Polymorphism (being able to present the same interface for different underlying data types. For example by making the class responsible for its own data, we can do shape.Draw() instead of drawSquare(), drawCircle() etc. 



Q: in an ecommerce application, with discrete levels of stock, how would you manage a situation where two customers were interested in buying the last unit of stock for an item? How would your solution ensure the greatest possibility of the item being sold?
A: If there was an item on amazon, and it says one item left. If someone puts it in their shopping cart, I would lock the item out so that other people can’t put it in their cart as well. After like 5-10min. I would just make the item available again. 



Q: How would you refactor code?
BUD approach for code efficiency:
Bottlenecks, unnecessary work, duplicated work



Q: Tell me the greatest challenge you’ve faced
A: helping a teammate that’s not doing much work get better instead of doing it for them.
Algorithm question reversing a matrix. Step by step. Small chunks. 

Q: Tell me your greatest accomplishment. 
A: Even though its not impressive. Just show confidence in what you know.
 


Q: Tell me about your previous projects
A:

During the pandemic, after taking a javascript tutorial. I created this choice-driven story app for kids. My main aim for this project was to improve my skills in constructor functions, Dom manipulations, local storage. 
Improvement: make it into a responsive design. I’ve mostly used vanilla javascript, so I would love to refactor the whole program. use css to make it prettier. 
Also implement modular programming(separating functionality of a program into different modules). Classes for the different animals, make use of OOP.

I also created a Restaurant decider app since my gf has the hardest time deciding what to eat for dinner. It’s basically a survey app that uses local storage and it spits out a graph at the end. 
Improvement: I would love to play around with google API and have the app search for the actual restaurants nearby with the ratings, store hours, walking distance. 
Also refactor since it’s vanilla js.

Another app I’ve had experience building was a tic tac toe game. This was just a code along project of a tutorial. However, I added a computer to play against in the game. I was fascinated with the min max algorithm at that time and took time to learn it and implement it to the game.
Improvements: I need to create a html and connect it with flask. I don’t have any visuals for this game right now. It’s all done in python. 

I also created a Jeopardy game because I wanted to improve my API design.



Q: Where do you see yourself in five years? Ten years?
A: In five years? I see myself as a senior engineer. Helping and sharing my knowledge with other engineers. I know the struggle, I know what it takes to teach and push yourself. I want to make that process a little lighter for all the new engineers coming into my team. In 10 years? I want to be versatile and knowledgeable enough to be of help for any departments. I want to be the person people come to to ask questions. 



Q: If you have multiple projects on your plate, how do you handle completing them on time?
I would first look at which projects the company sees as important, and I’ll plan a timeline for each project. The priorities will be based on the importance and timeline of each project.


Q: What is your weakness? 
I'm not good at estimating how long a project will take me. Actually creating the program and testing, refactor takes a lot of time. I’ve underestimate the second part of the project in the past. To improve on this, I’ve been timing myself when I do any assessments or projects so that I know what I struggle with, or takes more time than I thought it would be. To get an idea how long a project will take me.


I constantly second guess myself checking for debugs and edge cases. To resolve this, I’m planning to get better with unit and integration testings and also debugging tools. 

Limited versatility in stacks. So I do have several frameworks and libraries I want to learn and practice using it.


Q: What are your strengths?
From what I’ve noticed comparing myself to my peers, I’m good at researching something and understanding it. It’s not that I’m not afraid to ask for help, I do ask for help if I need it, but usually I can come to the solution by myself.

I’m a good team player and I’m very flexible. I can adjust to sudden changes pretty well.



Q: What work environment do you dislike working in?
I tend to dislike working in a solo setting. I’m not talking about remote, more like freelance situations. I believe that true efficiency can only be achieve through a team where you share knowledge and cover each others weaknesses. If you are working on a problem, but someone else has already tackled the problem in the past, it’s better to share the knowledge so that I can get unstuck and move on to the next task.



Q: It is often said that a career in healthcare is a 'thankless job.' How can we keep you motivated and engaged, even on the days when you feel your work goes unnoticed?
I mainly get motivated by growth. As long as I'm learning and improving, I get satisfaction from that. I don’t want to be the same person as I was last month. I love the feeling of accomplishment by solving problems, whether it be debugging or algorithms. 




Q: Patient care requires a strong amount of compassion. Do you consider yourself a compassionate person?
I work in a dental office that specializes in dental anxiety. Compassion is almost a requirement to work there in order to tend to the patients needs. I've always been responsive to my patients' and my coworkers’ needs. 



Q: When have you shown a willingness to learn a new method or new approach to solving a problem?
A: I’m normally doing traditional hygiene procedures. At our office we have a restorative hygienist that takes care of most of the restorative needs. A month before she went on maternity leave, I volunteered to take over some of her restorative cases. I trained for about 3 weeks in order to fill in for her role.
Programming wise: on one of the js project, we were told that learning Jquery was only an option. I still took time to learn Jquery and implement it to my project because I wanted to see for myself if was worth using it in the future. I know it makes the app heavy and your regular js can do it better and faster. But I know a lot of companies out there still use vanilla js and Jquery so I wanted to learn it to be more versatile. 



Q: Accolade seeks to hire those with strong problem solving skills. When were you able to successfully resolve a problem in the workplace?
A: programming problems can eventually be solved. I believe real problem solving skills involve people. front desk and back office patient issue.



Q: In your opinion, what makes you a great problem solver?
A: I might not solve things as fast as some people out there but I can steadily solve a problem by taking small chunks.



How would you describe your personality?
Reliable, organized, and flexible. I’m organized but I’m very flexible. If there’s a change in plan schedule, I can adapt to it right away. I don’t get stress if the plan changes. I love being the jack of all trades. I strive to be the person where people go to for help whenever they have a question.

FRONT-END INTERVIEW (JAVASCRIPT)

Q: What is javascript
A: interpreted
OOP(thanks to ES6)
Considered a Scripting language thanks to the browser acting as an application.



Q: What does it mean to be strongly typed?
A: it means all constants or variables defined must be described with one of the data. Has strict restrictions on intermixing of values with differing data types. types. (Smalltalk, Perl, Ruby, Python(both strong and dynamically typed), and Self)



Q: Difference between statically typed vs dynamically typed?
A: Statically typed is if the type of a variable is known at COMPILE time opposed to run-time. (Java, C, C++). Benefit is that trivial bugs can be caught during compiling. 
Dynamically typed is associated with run-time values(period of time when the program is running). That means you don’t have to specify types every time. (Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang)



Q: What is scripting language.
A: series of commands that are able to be executed without the need for compiling therefore, interpreter based. (PHP, Perl, Python(server side scripting so needs server to process) and Javascript(thanks to the browser is a scripting language and it is client-side))



Q: Interpreted vs Compiled
A: interpreted is designed to execute source code directly and without the need to compile a program into machine-learning instructions. It is run line-by-line at runtime.
Benefit is running incomplete programs making development convenient. Disadvantage is that it compiles during runtime degrading performance making it the poor choice for CPU-intensive tasks.
Compiled language translates high level programming into lower level language in order for the program to execute.(Java, C and C++)



Q: high vs low level programming language:
A: low level is machine-oriented (assembly and machine language). High level is programmer friendly. 



Q: What is the difference between GET and POST when making an AJAX request? 
A: GET and POST are two different HTTP requests. GET is for retrieving data from a remote server and POST when sending data to create/update a resource. For example. User creates a new blog post, and you want to send that data to the server to be saved.



Q: What does JSON stand for and what is it used for?
A: Javascript object notation. It’s a Text-based data format that’s easy to transfer across the web.
When you request for data from an API, typically it comes in JSON format. The structure looks a lot like object literal so it’s pretty easy to convert them. 



Q: What is the difference between == and === ?
A: == checks for equality and === checks for equality AND type.

 == will try to coerce two values into the same data TYPE. === will not. Ex: 2 == ‘2’ is true. 2 === ‘2’ is false. False == 0 is True. False === 0 is false. 



Q: What’s the difference between Null and undefined and undeclared variables.
A: Null: object. Intentional absence of value. Basically null has a value with no value. It is not zero, not an empty string/object/array. 
Undefined: data type. It has been declared but NOT initialized(allocate memory for the variable) or defined. This will get undefined.
Undeclared variables are not declared(the variable is not registered). This will get a reference error. However, will return undefined AS A STRING.
They are both Falsy. 




Q: Difference between var, let and const?
A: var is function scoped. Counts and let are block-scoped. EX: you can access the var in a block scope such as if or for loop statement outside the block. But you can’t access the var in a FUNCTION outside the block.
Let and const are block scoped(In curly braces) Var is global when it is declared outside a function.
* Var can be updated and re-declared within its scope. Let variables can be updated but not re-declared. Const CANNOT be redeclared nor updated.
*There’s one more thing with var, let and const. Var and let can be declared and not be defined and will result in undefined. HOWEVER the typeof you get from the declared let says undefined IN STRING. BUT if you do compare it with triple equal (foo === undefined), it will return True. BUT THEN if you declare let variable with the string ‘undefined’ and compare it with triple equal, you will get False. Const cannot be declared without being defined.

*fun fact: declared variable with null will result in typeof ‘object’ in string.

EXAMPLE:
Let foo;
console.log(typeof foo); // “undefined” as a string
console.log(typeof bar); // undeclared, but also returns “undefined”

Console.log(foo === undefined); // true boolean

Const boo = ‘undefined’;
console.log(boo === undefined); // false boolean.



Q: What is the event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?
A: javascript is a single threaded programming language. This means that javascript can do only one thing at a single point in time.




Q: What is hoisting 
A: VAR: It’s when variables and function declarations(functions written as statements) are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. 
LET/CONST: people mistakenly think that let and const DO NOT get hoisted but they do. let and const declarations are hoisted to the top like var. Unlike var which is initialized(When you declare a variable, it is automatically initialized(allocates memory for the variable)) as undefined, the let and const keyword is not initialized. So you will get a reference error instead of undefined (var will get undefined).



Q: What are the data types supported by JS?
A: 7 primitive data types are string, number(includes Infinity and NaN), boolean, null, undefined, symbol(immutable, unique identifier), BigInt(an integer value larger than 2^53 -1)



Q: What are symbol types in js?
A: so.. object property keys may be either string or symbol type. Symbol basically represents a unique identifier, hence guaranteed to be unique. symbols don’t auto convert to strings unlike most values. 
BENEFITS OF SYMBOL: allows us to create hidden properties of an object. Since symbol cannot be accessed accidentally it might be good to use it in an object that belongs to another code so that they don’t access accidentally. 
symbols are skipped by (for…in)



Q: What do the break and the continue statements do?
A: continue skips one iterations of the loop. Break will jump out of that loop.



Q: What is ternary expression? What does the word Ternary indicate?
A: An operator that takes three arguments.
*Conditional(ternary) operator is the only javascript operator that takes three operands. 
Example: 
(isMember ? ‘$2’ : ‘$10’);


Q: Explain event delegation?
A: If you attach an event delegation to a Dom element, it is firing on every children of that element. This happens through a process called event bubbling.



Q: Describe event bubbling?
A: event propagation in the HTML DOM API. The event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. events on an element will bubble up and also fire on all parents.



Q: What’s the difference between “target” and “currentTarget” in an event listener.
A: target is the thing actually clicked(actual element that triggered it). currentTarget is what you attach the event listener to. 


Q: what is an expression.
A: a statement that produces a value. Conditional is an expression that evaluates to true or false.

Q: What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):
A: IIFE is a design pattern for js. It’s a JS function that runs as soon as it is defined. Also known as (Self-Executing Anonymous Function). The parenthesis around the function prevents it from polluting the global scope and preventing the variable in it to be used elsewhere. And () at the end will interpret the function. 
(Function () {
	statements
})();



Q: Explain why the following doesn’t work as an IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression):
Function foo() {
	statement
}();
A: 
1st example:
function foo() {
	// This is a definition or statement
}

2nd example:
Var foo = function() {
	// this is an expression. It resolves to a value even if just “undefined”
};

*The 1st example won’t run since it’s not an actual value more of a reference. However, you can make it run by putting (…) around the functions making js is going to interpret it as an expression not a statement like:
(Function foo() {
	statement
})();



Q: Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it? 
A: reduces collision(you never know what libraries you will use in the future). Global scope is the javascript environment), maintain independence (helps you write your own code since its self contained).
So example, you don’t want to do this:
X = 5; 
Js will let you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared and it will attach that value to the global scope. This is not good. So declared global scope(when var is declared outside of a function) vs automatically global scope (when you set a value to a variable without declaring it ex: x = 2). That’s why we use strict mode (this prevents undeclared variables from automatically being global. 
In HTML, the global scope is the window object.
Global variables defined with the var keyword belongs in window object. Global variables defined with the let keyword does not belong in the window object.



Q: What is Lexical Scope?
A: means a local region or a restricted region. (lexical scope is the definition area of an expression.) In other words, an ITEM’s lexical scope is the place in which the ITEM got CREATED. Not the place the item got invoked but created.

Example:
Const fullName = “shiba inu”

Function profile() {
	Function sayName() {
		Function writeName() {
			Return fullName
		}
	}
}

From the function writeName, computer will call fullName but it won’t go to global scope directly, it will go step by step through the scope chain to look for the LEXICAL SCOPE of fullName. Therefore, fullName’s lexical scope is the global scope.

To see another example.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-lexical-scope-tutorial/



Q: What are truthy and falsy:
A: falsy: false, 0, -0, BitInt zero(0n), empty string, null, undefined, NaN
Truthy: true, ‘0’(string 0), ‘false’ (string false), [] (empty array), {} (empty object), function(){} (an empty function)



Q: Async vs Sync
A: a thread can perform multiple requests for async, and the thread on sync can only perform one request at a time.
setTimeout is an async function. 
Promise can handle nested callbacks better. Better readability.
Await can’t be used at a global level. It needs to be wrapped in a function. The await keyword is used in an async function to ensure that all promises returned in the async function are synchronized, Await eliminates the use of call backs then and catch.


Q: what are Callbacks.
A: In javascript, functions are objects. We can pass objects to functions as parameters. We can pass functions as a parameters to other functions and call them inside the outer functions. Callback is a function that is passed to another function.
Closure is a function combined with references to the variables defined outside of it.



Q: What is DOM and eventlistener?
A: Document Object Model is an interface that treats XML or HTML as a tree of Objects. Browser creates a DOM of the page when a webpage is loaded.
Eventlistener interface represents an object that can handle an event.


Q: Tell me what you know about this keyword.
A: this keyword basically represents

BACK-END INTERVIEW

Q: Reverse a binary tree problem


Q: Given a string (array of bytes) return a string that contains the hex value of each character.
A: For loop through each character in the string, get the character's ASCII value and convert that value into a hex value, adding to a new string as you go. It's critical to remember how to convert from decimal to hex here!


Q: Find the max value in a binary tree
A: recursion.
A: Begin at the root Node, recursively traverse to the right until you can no longer do so, then return the value You end up at.


Q: Find the max value in a binary tree, but do it iteratively.
A: Breadths-First-Search. I had a queue that pushed the head if it was not null and then continued to do that for each left and right node using a while loop.


Q: bit operator question: out put of (3<<2) & (3>>2)
A: bitwise operators



———————————————————————————————————————
SQL(relational database) NOSQL(non-relational database)

Q: SQL vs NOSQL
Sql database are vertically scalable(increase the load on a single server by increasing RAM, SSD, CPU. while Nosql are horizontally scalable(adding more servers). SQL databases are table based while NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases.



Q: In SQL database tables, why is redundant data (i.e. the same data stored in multiple tables) generally a bad thing. 
A: When you modify the data, it needs to be done in multiple places. Increases the size of the database and cost, decreases efficiency. Data inconsistency



Q: In SQL database tables, why might redundant data be necessary in real world applications?
A: recovery purposes. Data reliability, faster data access



Q: Benefits of relational database
A: * speed is higher because of its ease and simplicity.
* Secure because certain tables can be confidential.
* Simple because it does not use query processing and complex structuring.
Accurate since it uses primary and foreign keys. All data is non-repetitive.
Multi access at the same time. Even if it is updated.


Disadvantages:
If there are too many tables, the response given to the queries will be slower.
physical storage. Vertical scaling. More cpu, ssd, ram. 
Even though it is free from complex structuring, it can become complex when the amount of data in a relational database increases. 

Specifications, consideration (use case, performance, resiliency(recover the data, redundancy)), input, output, who is the customer.

SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS/NOTES

FLASK NOTES:
Flask sessions are more secure in a way. 
Sessions are “signed” so users can’t modify data and the data is stored as readable language.

In Flask, the sessions are stored in the browser as a cookie (client side session). Session in flask is different than session storage.
In Flask-Session, the sessions are stored in the server side.

LocalStorage: stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through Javascript, or clearing the Browser

SessionStorage: Stores data only for until the browser or tab is closed. Larger than a cookie.

Cookie: cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie. Sent from the browser to the server for every request to the same domain. Set usually from server-side. Can be read by a server.



———————————————————————————————————————

PYTHON TEST NOTES:

Unit tests promote modular programming.
Assert will stop the rest of the code from running so it’s not good for comprehensive testing. It does not give feedback.
