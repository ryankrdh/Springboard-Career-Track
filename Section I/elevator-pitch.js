Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Ryan and I've been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I mainly work with patients that have severe anxiety.

I recently joined a full stack boot camp back in 2021 planning to switch my career to a software engineer role. 

I've built and maintained an accelerated hygiene program for couple dental offices doubling their hygiene revenue. 

I'm particularly interested in working for startup-like environments where I can grow fast and be curious. During the quarantine, knowing how the kids are bored at home, I built a choice-driven story app. 

I highly value communication and teamwork because I believe that even as a programmer, there is a limit to what you can achieve alone. 

I would like to meet others just as passionate about creating programs that can make peoples' lives easier. 


Would you be interested in connecting with me to discuss any opportunities?



** have a bullet point format.

first and last name.
if you dont mind, can I connect with you on linkedin?
