Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Ryan and I've been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I mainly work with patients that have severe anxiety.

I recently joined a full stack boot camp back in 2021 planning to switch my career to a software engineer role. 

I've built and maintained an accelerated hygiene program for couple dental offices doubling their hygiene revenue. 

I'm particularly interested in working for startup-like environments where I can grow fast and be curious. During the quarantine, knowing how the kids are bored at home, I built a choice-driven story app. 

I highly value communication and teamwork because I believe that even as a programmer, there is a limit to what you can achieve alone. 

I would like to meet others just as passionate about creating programs that can make peoples' lives easier. 


Would you be interested in connecting with me to discuss any opportunities?


Well I've been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I mainly work with patients that have severe dental anxiety.  I've built and maintained an accelerated hygiene program for couple dental offices doubling their hygiene revenue. During the pandemic I learned some basic programming and created a choice driven story game for kids and fell in love with the industry. I've been learning and improving my programming skills every night after work in the hopes of meeting others just as passionate about creating programs that can put a smile on peoples' faces. 


** have a bullet point format.

first and last name.
