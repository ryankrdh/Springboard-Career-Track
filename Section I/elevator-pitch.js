Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Ryan and I've been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I mainly work with patients that have severe anxiety at the moment.

I recently joined a full stack boot camp back in 2021 planning to switch my career to a software engineer role. 

I've built and maintained an accelerated hygiene program for couple dental offices doubling their hygiene revenue. 

I'm particularly interested in working for startup-like environments where I can grow fast and be curious. During the quarantine, I know how kids are bored at home so I built a story driven app geared towards kids. 

I am very team-driven and passionate about creating programs that can make peoples' lives easier, and I'm sure I'll be a great addition to your team. 

Would you be interested in connecting with me to discuss any opportunities?
