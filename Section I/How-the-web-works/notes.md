An Introduction
What Happens When…
When I type http://site.com/some/page.html

into a browser, what really happens?

This is a common interview question for software engineers.

How the Web Works
The internet is complicated.

Really, really complicated.

Fortunately, to be a software developer, you only need to know a bit.

For people who want to work in “development operations,” or as a system administrator, it’s typical to have to learn more about the details here.

Networks
A network is a set of computers that can intercommunicate.

The internet is just a really, really big network.

The internet is made up of smaller, “local” networks.

Hostnames
We often talk to servers by “hostname” — site.com or computer-a.site.com.

That’s just a nickname for the server, though — and the same server can have many hostnames.

IP Addresses
On networks, computers have an “IP Address” — a unique address to find that computer on the network.

IP addresses look like 123.77.32.121, four numbers (0-255) connected by dots.

There are a lot of advanced edges here that make this more complicated, but most of these details aren’t important for software engineers:

there another whole way to specify networks, “IPv6”, that use a different numbering scheme.
some computers can have multiple IP addresses they can be reached by
under some circumstances, multiple computers can share an IP address and have this be handled by a special kind of router. If you’re interested in system administration details, you can learn about this by reading about “Network Address Translation”.
