AJAX
Traditional Requests
Traditional browser requests happen in response to:

Entering a URL in the browser bar
Clicking on a link
Submitting a form
In all cases:

Browser makes request
Receives response
Replaces entire resource with result

AJAX
AJAX web request:

Made from JavaScript in browser
JavaScript makes request (GET, POST, or other)
You receive a response
Do whatever you want with result!
AJAX is a technique in Javascript for sending requests and receiving responses from a server without having to reload the browser page.

What Does AJAX stand for?

AJAX originally was an acronym for “Asynchronous Javascript and XML”. However many people don’t send XML over AJAX nowadays; it’s more common to send HTML or JSON. The technology is still the same, though, even if the data payload is commonly different. Ultimately, AJAX is a cooler sounding acronym than AJAJ or AJAH.
