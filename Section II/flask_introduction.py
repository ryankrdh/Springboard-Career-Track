# What is a Web Server?
# A program that’s running on a machine and waiting for a web request.

# Note: A web server is a technology that can process requests and issue responses via HTTP, a protocol used to distribute information on the world wide web. Though it’s also used to refer to computer systems and even internet “appliances,” we’ll use web server to refer to the software running on a machine that’s waiting to respond to HTTP requests.
