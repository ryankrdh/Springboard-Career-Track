schema - a logical representation of a database including its tables
SQL - Structured Query Language, a human-readable language for querying
table (aka “relation”) - basically a spreadsheet, a set of columns and rows
column - a table attribute, e.g. “first_name”, “last_name”, or “company”
row - a table record with values for set for columns, e.g. “Matt, Lane, Rithm”
Nearly all relational DBs use SQL to modify/query data
